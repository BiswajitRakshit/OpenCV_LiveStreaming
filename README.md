Face and eyes detection using xml model of Haarcascades

In order to do object recognition/detection with cascade files, you first need cascade files. 

For the extremely popular tasks, these already exist. 

Detecting things like faces, cars, smiles, eyes, and license plates for example are all pretty prevalent.

You can use Google to find various Haar Cascades of things you may want to detect. 

You shouldn't have too much trouble finding the aforementioned types.

We will use a Face cascade and Eye cascade. 

You can find a few more at the root directory of Haar cascades. 

Note the license for using/distributing these Haar Cascades.
